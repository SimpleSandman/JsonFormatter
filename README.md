# Json Formatter
A Visual Studio 2017/2019 toolbar extension that will minify or prettify JSON files inside your code window. This was created with the idea of pressing a button to format `.json` files in compressed or pretty formats.

I was looking around for a simple extension that I can use with one-click format my JSON files, but the closest one I found (at the time of writing this) was only supported on Visual Studio 2015. So I decided to take it upon myself to create this VS extension.

I would love to get feedback and help with any additional features this toolbox extension can bring. This is also my first extension I've ever built!

## Two Simple Features
- Minify
- Prettify

## How-To's

- Add the extension to your toolbar
